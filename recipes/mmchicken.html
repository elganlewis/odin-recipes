    <p>Win someone over with this creamy chicken casserole. It's a great family meal served with mash, or new potatoes, and green beans</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>30g plain flour</li>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>125g sundried tomatoes; in oil, drained and roughly chopped, 3 tbsp oil reserved</li>
        <li>1 red onion; finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves; crushed or finely grated</li>
        <li>Â½ - 1 tsp chilli flakes (to taste)</li>
        <li>2 - 3 thyme or oregano sprigs; leaves picked, or 1 tsp mixed dried herbs</li>
        <li>150ml double cream</li>
        <li>250ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>35g parmesan; grated</li>
        <li>8 - 10 basil leaves; torn, to serve</li>
        <li>lemon wedges; to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour on a plate and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Coat the chicken in the flour.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the sundried tomato oil in a large, lidded frying pan over a medium heat and fry the chicken for 8-10 mins until golden all over, but not cooked through. Set the chicken aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the remaining 1 tbsp sundried tomato oil into the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low. Fry the onion for 8-10 mins until softened but not golden. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute before adding the sundried tomatoes, chilli and thyme or oregano, stirring well.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken back to the pan, then pour over the cream and chicken stock, and season well. Put the lid on the pan and cook on medium-low for about 20 mins, turning the chicken halfway through until it is cooked through and the sauce has thickened a little. Stir in the parmesan, then serve with a scattering of basil leaves and lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
